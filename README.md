# bestremote (version 1.0.alpha.1)
This is the code for www.bestremoteworker.com

## DESCRIPTION
This is a dead simple website I am making to showcase my front end skills.

There are two markdown files:  
* README.md is for where we left off at, and what to do next.  
  This should be short and concise!
* NOTES.md is for longer stuff (often mentioned in this README)...

## LEFT OFF
* made site structure

## NEXT STEPS
* add FTP account 
* upload site bones, test it
