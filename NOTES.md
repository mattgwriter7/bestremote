# NOTES 
This is a place for stuff that doesn't fit under README

## NAMING CONVENTIONS
* variables be "lowercase_with_hyphens"
* methods be "camelCased()"...
* classes will be capitalized, and always have the filename exactly match
  the class name (so the "Config" class is "Config.dart", for instance)
* REALLY_IMPORTANT varibles will be all caps and underscored
   + but there should only be 1 or 2 "really important" variables in the app

## GOAL
At themoment my goal is to make a single page website.  It is going to have super clean, spartan code, and ideally will be able to be used as a boiler plate for other simple sites when I need to spin one off.

## IDEAS
Make it so many websites all go to bestremoteworker.com (using 
querystring).

## HISTORY
... none yet...
